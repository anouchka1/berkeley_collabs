This is a visualization created for the cover of the spring 2014 issue of <a href=http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu>Berkeley Science Review</a>. It depicts scientific collaborations among UC Berkeley academic departments, programs, and local research organizations, based on article co-authorship. Each ring segment represents an individual program. Mouse over a segment to focus on a program. The thickness of the links between programs represents the number of PubMed-indexed research articles published between 1994 and 2014 by authors affiliated with both programs.
